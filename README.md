# Edu-Ai: Enhancing Learning with Artificial Intelligence

Edu-Ai is a cutting-edge project leveraging the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance the learning experience. This project encompasses innovative features designed to revolutionize education:

1. **Student Attentiveness Analysis**
   - Utilizes real-time facial tracking with machine learning libraries such as dlib and OpenCV to analyze students' attentiveness during lectures.
   - Employs advanced algorithms to provide insightful metrics, offering a nuanced understanding of students' engagement levels.

2. **Lecture Transcription and Summarization Tool**
   - Focuses on optimizing the consumption of educational content by extracting audio from recorded lectures.
   - Integrates OpenAI's advanced Whisper model for accurate transcription and uses intelligent algorithms for efficient content review.

3. **Teacher-Student Interaction (Coming Soon)**
   - Teachers can upload resources such as PDFs, research papers, etc.
   - Students can engage with an AI chatbot that references uploaded resources to answer their questions.

## Features
